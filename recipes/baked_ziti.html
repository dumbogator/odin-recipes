    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Baked ziti is a casserole with ziti pasta and a Neapolitan-style tomato sauce. It is a characteristic of Italian-American cuisine.[12][13] It is a form of pasta al forno.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically, the pasta is first boiled separately until it is nearly, but not completely, done. The almost-cooked pasta is added to a tomato-based sauce. The tomato-coated pasta is then combined with cheese, typically a mixture of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Other ingredients can be added with the cheese, such as ground meat, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and onions. The combined ingredients are placed in a baking dish, covered with mozzarella cheese, baked in the oven and served hot.[14] If unavailable, ziti can be substituted with other tubular pastas such as penne or rigatoni.
